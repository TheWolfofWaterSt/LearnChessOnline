          Now that you know how the pieces move, it's time to get playing. 
          There are a number of online chess sites to play chess both against
          a computer and against other people over the internet. The following
          are 2 of my favorite sites to get started playing right away
        </p>
        
        <h2><a href="https://www.chess.com">Chess.com</a></h2>

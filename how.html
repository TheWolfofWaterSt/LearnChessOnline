        <p>
          To begin playing chess all you need is a chess set. This can be a set online playing 
          against a computer or another person. This could also be a physical chess set playing 
          against someone else. A chess board is an 8x8 grid of alternating colors with a label 
          for each square. Each column (or file) is denote by a letter A-H from white’s perspective. 
          Each row (or rank) is denoted by a number 1-8 beginning from whites perspective going up. 
          So the 3rd file, 4th rank would be the square C4 for example. 
        </p>
        <p>
          There are 32 chess pieces, 16 white and 16 black. These pieces are 8 pawns, 2 rooks, 2 knights, 
          2 bishops, a king, and a queen. They each have an initial position as shown above. Once the pieces 
          are set and the players are ready, the game can begin. The first move is always made by the white 
          side player. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The goal of chess is simple, yet deceptively so, trap the enemy king. To do this, 
          one must play with strategy and thought to every move. And to do <em>this</em> one must 
          know how each piece moves. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Pawn</h2>
        <img src="images/PawnMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the Pawn Moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          On a pawn’s first move you have the choice to move either 1 or 2 squares. After a pawn has 
          made its initial move it can only move one square at a time. A pawn can only move in the 
          forward direction unless attacking another piece. However, pawns can only attack pieces in 
          a forward diagonal movement. If a pawn comes to a piece directly in front of it, it cannot 
          move anymore unless the piece blocking its way is moved. 
        </p>
        <h2>Rook</h2>
        <img src="images/RookMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the Rook moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          A rook can move as far or as near as it wants as long as it is in a vertical or horizontal 
          direction. It can capture any piece in its direct path. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Knight</h2>
        <img src="images/KnightMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the Knight moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          The knight has a strange movement to it. It has to move in an L shape for a total of 3 squares. 
          The L can be made up of any combination of squares as long as it has a vertical and horizontal 
          component. It can capture any piece that it can move to. A knight is the only piece that can jump 
          over other pieces, however it must land on either a free space, or a space occupied by the opposite 
          color in which case it captures that piece. 
        </p>  
        
        <h2>Bishop</h2>
        <img src="images/BishopMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the Bishop Moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          The bishop moves similarly to the rook in which it can go as far or as near as it wants, 
          however it has to move diagonally. And this also means the way the chess board is set up that 
          one bishop can only move on light squares, and the other bishop can only move on dark squares. 
          This goes the same for capturing pieces. A light square bishop will never be able to capture a 
          piece on a dark square and vice versa. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Queen</h2>
        <img src="images/QueenMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the Queen moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. It can move in any direction, as far or as near 
          as it wants as long as there is not a piece blocking its way. For this reason, the queen can be used 
          in a lot of different scenarios. In a central position the queen can apply pressure to all areas 
          of the board. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>King</h2>
        <img src="images/KingMovement.jpg" class="howto" alt="How the King Moves" height="400" width="400">
        <p>
          The king is the most important piece on the board. The game is revolved around the king and 
          ends when the king is trapped and unable to move. Its movements however are limited. It can move 
          in any direction, but only one space at a time. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Check and Mate</h2>
        <div class="sideby">
          <img src="images/Check.jpg" alt="a King in check" height="400" width="400">
          <img src="images/Checkmate.jpg" alt="a King in checkmate" height="400" width="400">
        </div>
        <p>
          The king is in check when it is under attack by an opposing piece but still has a way to get out of 
          check. You can get out of check by moving to a space where the king is no longer in check or by 
          capturing the piece that is placing the piece in check. Checkmate is when the king is in check with 
          no way to get out of check. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Point Values</h2>
        <p>
          A good way to know if you are &quot;winning&quot; at any point in the game is by an assigned point 
          value to each piece. As you gain material by capturing the opponents pieces they get more and more 
          at a disadvantage. Each piece with its point value can help determine if trading pieces puts you at 
          more of an advantage or disadvantage. This table shows how each piece is valued. A pawn is worth 1 point, 
          knights and bishops are worth 3 points, a rook is worth 9 points, and a king is not valued as it is never
          technically captured. So for a quick example, losing a knight to capture a rook puts you ahead by 2 points
          of material as a rook is worth 5 and a knight is worth 3. Trading a bishop for a knight is an even trade as
          they are the same point value. Losing a rook and a knight to capture a queen still techincally puts you in 
          a more advantageous position as far as point values go.

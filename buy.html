          The board is made from beech and birch wood that gives it a classic, handmade 
          feel that many chess enthusiasts will appreciate; number and letter algebraic 
          coordinates adorn the borders. Handcrafted chessmen are felt bottom and
          weighted; they are made from hornbeam and sycamore wood.
